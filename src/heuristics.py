#  Heuristic functions for search algorithms.
# A <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html">distance heuristic</a>
# provides an *estimate of the optimal distance cost* from a given location to a target.
# As such, it guides the pathfinder to the goal, helping it to decide which route is the best.
#
# This script holds the definition of some built-in heuristics available through jumper.
#
# Distance functions are internally used by the `pathfinder` to evaluate the optimal path
# from the start location to the goal. These functions share the same prototype:
#     local function myHeuristic(nodeA, nodeB)
#       -- function body
#     end
# Jumper features some built-in distance heuristics, namely `MANHATTAN`, `EUCLIDIAN`, `DIAGONAL`, `CARDINTCARD`.
# You can also supply your own heuristic function, following the same template as above.
