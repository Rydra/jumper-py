A python port of [Jumper](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper), a pathfinding library originally developed by [Yonaba](https://github.com/Yonaba).

Jumper is a pathfinding library designed for grid-based games. It aims to be fast and lightweight. It features a wide range of search algorithms, built within a clean interface with chaining features which makes it very friendly and easy to use.

The original idea of jumper-py was to assess whether the readability of python is better or not than the readability of Lua (still trying to assess and forge an opinion on the matter). No benchmarking has been done yet.
